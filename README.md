University project as part of TDT4255 at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

The exercise was split in three parts:

1. A simple stack machine
-----------
An simple introduction to VHDL and the toolchain where we had to build a simple stack-machine that can calculate
mathematical expressions with +, -, * and / written in reverse polish notation.
None of us had ever touched VHDL or any hardware description language, so it was an helpful introduction.

2. A MIPS machine
-----------
