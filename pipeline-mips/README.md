Pipelined MIPS CPU
===============

We pipelined the processor from the last exercise. And then introduced optimizations, such as forwarding, hazard detection and branch handling to deal with the pipeline hazards.
This processor was also successfully tested on a Spartan-6 FPGA.
We spent quite some time playing with the VHDL language to try to implement the pipeline registers as clean as possible, which can be seen in various branches of this repository.

This exercise also accounted for 25% of our grade.
